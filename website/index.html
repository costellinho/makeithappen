					As part of J.P.Morgans School Outreach programme we intend to enable pupils to think, design and (if they win) build an application with the help of our expert engineers.<br/><br/>Our goal is to reach all pupils from P1-P7 and let them start their digital design thinking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
